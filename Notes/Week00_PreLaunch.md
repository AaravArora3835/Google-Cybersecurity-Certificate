## Reflection

**What went well:**
- VM setup was smoother than expected
- Folder structure feels professional and organized
- Screenshot naming convention is clean and searchable
- Financial aid approved on schedule
- Taking a break before launch was the right call

**What I learned:**
- Importance of VM snapshots (can restore if something breaks)
- Professional file naming makes things easier to find later
- Organization up front saves time later
- Pre-planning reduces Week 1 stress

**Confidence level going into launch:** 8/10

**Why 8/10:**
- Technical setup complete (VMs working perfectly)
- Folder structure ready
- Templates created
- Financial aid approved
- Roadmap v4.8 locked and ready
- Slight concern about time management (school + 7.5 hrs/week)
- First time doing structured self-study at this scale
