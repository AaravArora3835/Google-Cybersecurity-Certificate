---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 18)**

1. Network monitoring provides visibility into attacks that bypass endpoint security.
2. Baseline understanding enables anomaly detection — must know "normal" before identifying "abnormal."
3. IDS detects threats, IPS blocks them — different tools for different security goals.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 18)**

Completed Module 2 content and quizzes.
Studied Wireshark packet analysis examples.
Reviewed network protocol behaviors for common attacks.

**Purpose:** Build network analysis foundation for threat detection and CVE exploitation research.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 19)**

* Module 3: Incident investigation and response
* Learn digital forensics basics
* Study evidence handling procedures

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 19)**

### **Module 3: Incident Investigation and Response**

**Key Concepts:**

* Digital forensics fundamentals and investigation process
* Evidence collection, preservation, and chain of custody
* Log analysis and correlation across systems
* Incident timeline reconstruction techniques
* Containment strategies: isolation, segmentation, system shutdown
* Eradication: removing threat actor access and malware
* Recovery: restoring systems and verifying security
* Communication during incidents (technical team, management, legal, PR)
* Post-incident analysis and lessons learned documentation

**Important Terms:** Digital Forensics, Chain of Custody, Log Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Mortem, Root Cause Analysis

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 19)**

1. Evidence handling procedures are critical for legal proceedings and effective analysis.
2. Containment must balance stopping the attack with preserving forensic evidence.
3. Post-incident reviews prevent future occurrences — not just blame assignment.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 19)**

Completed Module 3 lectures and assessments.
Analyzed incident response case studies.
Reviewed evidence documentation templates.

**Purpose:** Understand professional investigation standards for future security work and CVE documentation.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 20)**

* Module 4: IDS and SIEM tools
* Learn SIEM query fundamentals
* Study alert rule creation

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 20)**

### **Module 4: Network Traffic and Logs Using IDS and SIEM Tools**

**Key Concepts:**

* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) architecture and data flow
* Log aggregation, normalization, and parsing
* Detection rule creation and tuning
* Alert prioritization and false positive reduction
* Common SIEM platforms: Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), Google Chronicle, IBM QRadar
* IDS signature development and maintenance
* Threat hunting methodology using SIEM data
* Security metrics: MTTD (Mean Time to Detect), MTTR (Mean Time to Respond)
* Correlation rules for detecting multi-stage attacks

**Important Terms:** SIEM, Log Aggregation, Alert Rules, False Positive, Splunk, Chronicle, IDS Signature, Threat Hunting, Correlation

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 20)**

1. SIEM tools enable detection at scale by correlating events across entire infrastructure.
2. Alert tuning is continuous — reducing false positives without missing real threats.
3. Threat hunting proactively searches for threats rather than waiting for alerts.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 20)**

Completed Module 4 content and assessments.
Studied SIEM query syntax examples (Splunk SPL basics).
Reviewed detection rule logic and alert workflows.

**Purpose:** Learn enterprise security tools used in SOC environments and internship roles.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 21)**

* Complete Course 6 final assessment
* Screenshot course completion
* Document week's progress
* Plan Week 08 and CVE #2 work

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 21)**

### **Course 6 Review & Career Application**

**Key Concepts:**

* End-to-end incident response workflow integration
* Detection to response pipeline in SOC operations
* Tool ecosystem in modern security operations
* Incident metrics and KPIs for effectiveness measurement
* SOC analyst career paths (Tier 1, 2, 3 progression)
* Continuous improvement through lessons learned

**Important Terms:** Incident Metrics, MTTD, MTTR, SOC Analyst, Security Operations, Continuous Monitoring

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 21)**

1. Course 6 connected detection, analysis, and response into complete security operations picture.
2. SOC analyst skills (monitoring, triaging, investigating) directly apply to internship roles.
3. Detection and response knowledge improves CVE exploitation understanding — know how defenders see attacks.

# **Weekly Reflection**

**What Worked:**
* Completed entire course in one focused week — maintaining momentum on certification.
* Detection and response concepts complement offensive security knowledge from CVE #1.
* Understanding defender perspective improves attack methodology and mitigation recommendations.

**What Could Improve:**
* Two consecutive theory-heavy weeks — need hands-on lab work in Week 08.
* Should have taken more detailed notes on SIEM query syntax for future reference.
* Need to schedule practical IDS/SIEM lab work or TryHackMe rooms.

**Connections Made:**
* Network monitoring (Module 2) reveals how defenders detect SQLi attacks from CVE #1.
* SIEM correlation rules (Module 4) show how multiple suspicious events trigger alerts.
* Incident investigation procedures (Module 3) structure how to document CVE exploitation properly.
* Log analysis skills apply directly to analyzing web server logs during penetration testing.

**Next Week Focus:**
* Start Course 7 (Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python)
* Initialize VulnForge CVE #2 — target XSS or privilege escalation vulnerability
* Balance theory with practical exploitation work
* Consider TryHackMe SIEM or network analysis rooms for hands-on practice
