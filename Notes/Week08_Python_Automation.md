# **Week 08 — Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python**

**Date Range:** Dec 23, 2025 (Single Day Completion)
**Total Hours:** 13
**Phase:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Course 7

---

# **Course Overview**

Course 7 was significantly shorter than previous courses, focusing on Python fundamentals for security automation. Completed all modules in one intensive study session.

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 23)**

### **Module 1: Introduction to Python**

**Key Concepts:**

* Python's role in security automation
* Programming fundamentals: variables, data types, operators
* Python syntax and indentation rules
* Comments and code documentation
* Basic input/output operations
* Python interpreter and script execution
* Security use cases for Python (log parsing, automation, tool development)

**Important Terms:** Variable, Data Type, Operator, Syntax, Interpreter, Script, Integer, String, Float, Boolean

---

### **Module 2: Write Effective Python Code**

**Key Concepts:**

* Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
* Comparison and logical operators
* Code structure and readability
* Functions: definition, parameters, return values
* Built-in functions (print(), len(), type(), range())
* Iterative statements (for loops, while loops)
* Loop control (break, continue)
* Error handling fundamentals

**Important Terms:** Conditional, Function, Parameter, Return Value, Loop, Iteration, Control Flow, Built-in Function

---

### **Module 3: Work with Strings and Lists**

**Key Concepts:**

* String manipulation and methods (upper(), lower(), strip(), split(), replace())
* String indexing and slicing
* String concatenation and formatting
* Lists: creation, indexing, slicing
* List methods (append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort())
* List iteration and comprehension
* Combining strings and lists for data processing
* Practical security applications (parsing logs, processing IOCs)

**Important Terms:** String Method, Indexing, Slicing, List, List Method, Concatenation, String Formatting, List Comprehension

---

### **Module 4: Python in Practice**

**Key Concepts:**

* File operations: opening, reading, writing, closing files
* Working with CSV and text files
* Regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching
* Importing and using Python libraries
* Debugging techniques and error messages
* Writing modular, reusable code
* Real-world security automation scenarios
* Python scripts for log analysis and threat detection

**Important Terms:** File Handling, Regular Expression (Regex), Module, Import, Library, Debugging, CSV, Pattern Matching

---

# **Labs Completed (Dec 23)**

### **Python Fundamentals Labs (Integrated Throughout Course)**

**Skills Practiced:**

* Writing Python scripts for basic automation tasks
* String manipulation for log parsing
* List operations for data processing
* File reading/writing for security data analysis
* Using conditionals and loops for control flow
* Creating functions for reusable code
* Applying regex for pattern extraction

**Key Takeaways:**
Python syntax is straightforward — focus on logic and problem-solving.
String and list manipulation are essential for security data processing.
File operations enable automation of repetitive security tasks.
Functions make code modular and easier to maintain.

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 23)**

1. Python is the standard automation language for security operations — SOCs use it for log analysis, threat hunting, and tool integration.
2. String and list processing directly apply to parsing security logs, IOC lists, and vulnerability scan outputs.
3. File operations enable automated analysis of large datasets that manual review can't handle efficiently.
4. Regex skills are critical for extracting meaningful patterns from unstructured security data.
5. Course 7's brevity reflects Python fundamentals being more approachable than previous technical domains.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 23)**

Completed all module lectures, quizzes, and practice exercises.
Worked through Python coding examples and security automation scenarios.
Practiced string/list manipulation for log parsing use cases.

**Purpose:** Build Python foundation for security tool development, automation scripts, and CVE exploitation tooling.

---

# **Weekly Reflection**

**What Worked:**
* Course 7's shorter length allowed single-day completion without rushing — well-paced content.
* Python fundamentals clicked quickly due to clear explanations and practical examples.
* Immediate connection between Python skills and security automation use cases.
* 13-hour intensive session maintained focus and momentum.

**What Could Improve:**
* Should create custom Python scripts for portfolio beyond course exercises.
* Need to apply Python to VulnForge automation (case template generation, evidence organization).
* Could explore security-specific Python libraries (requests, scapy, pwntools) for CVE work.
* Should practice more regex patterns for real-world log parsing.

**Connections Made:**
* Python file operations can automate VulnForge case documentation generation.
* String parsing skills apply to analyzing web server logs during SQL injection testing.
* List processing enables batch analysis of multiple vulnerabilities or CVE reports.
* Regex patterns can extract IOCs from threat intelligence reports automatically.
* Python scripts can integrate with SIEM APIs for automated alert processing (Course 6 connection).

**Next Week Focus:**
* Start Course 8 (Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs) — final certification course
* Initialize VulnForge CVE #2 using Python automation where applicable
* Create custom Python script for portfolio (log parser, vulnerability scanner, or automation tool)
* Apply Python to improve VulnForge workflow efficiency
