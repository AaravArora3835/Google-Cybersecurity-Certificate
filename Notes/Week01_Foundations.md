## Topics Covered  

### 2025-10-29 — Module 1: *Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity*  

**Key Concepts**  
- Cybersecurity focuses on defending systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.  
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundation for all security controls.  
- A **cybersecurity analyst** detects, investigates, and responds to security incidents to reduce risk.  
- Security includes both technical controls (firewalls, encryption) and human factors (training, awareness).  
- Protecting digital assets requires policy, tools, and consistent monitoring of threats and vulnerabilities.  

**Important Terms**  
- **Confidentiality:** Ensures only authorized users can view data.  
- **Integrity:** Guarantees data accuracy and prevents tampering.  
- **Availability:** Keeps systems and data accessible when needed.  
- **Threat Actor:** An individual or group attempting to exploit a system.  
- **Risk:** The chance that a vulnerability will be exploited by a threat.

## Key Takeaways  
1. The CIA Triad defines how every security control is evaluated.  
2. Analysts must understand both technical defenses and human behavior.  
3. Communication and documentation are critical in incident response.

## Hands-On Labs  
**Lab Name:** No formal lab in Module 1  
**Activity Type:** Guided learning and practice quiz  
**Outcome:** Completed Module 1 knowledge checks and explored analyst responsibilities through scenario examples, but no technical environment was used.  
**Evidence:**

## Questions / Confusion  
- How does each pillar of the CIA Triad translate into specific tools (e.g., which tools support Integrity vs Availability)?  
- When incident logs are analyzed, how do analysts measure “Integrity” violations quantitatively?

## Next Steps  
- Start **Module 2 – The Evolution of Cybersecurity.**  
- Capture timeline screenshot (`2025-10-30_Module2_Timeline.png`).  
- Prepare notes on milestone events and the development of cybersecurity roles.
