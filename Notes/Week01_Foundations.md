## Topics Covered  

### 2025-10-29 — Module 1: *Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity*  

**Key Concepts**  
- Cybersecurity focuses on defending systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.  
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundation for all security controls.  
- A **cybersecurity analyst** detects, investigates, and responds to security incidents to reduce risk.  
- Security includes both technical controls (firewalls, encryption) and human factors (training, awareness).  
- Protecting digital assets requires policy, tools, and consistent monitoring of threats and vulnerabilities.  

**Important Terms**  
- **Confidentiality:** Ensures only authorized users can view data.  
- **Integrity:** Guarantees data accuracy and prevents tampering.  
- **Availability:** Keeps systems and data accessible when needed.  
- **Threat Actor:** An individual or group attempting to exploit a system.  
- **Risk:** The chance that a vulnerability will be exploited by a threat.

### 2025-10-31 — Module 2: *The Evolution of Cybersecurity* - COMPLETE

**Key Concepts**
- Cybersecurity evolved from basic virus protection in the 1980s to complex threat defense systems today.
- Major cybersecurity milestones include the Morris Worm (1988), Code Red (2001), and modern ransomware attacks.
- The rise of the internet, cloud computing, and IoT devices expanded the attack surface exponentially.
- Cybersecurity roles shifted from reactive (fixing breaches) to proactive (threat hunting, risk management).
- Compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA) emerged to standardize security practices across industries.

**Important Terms**
- **Threat Landscape:** The collection of all potential threats facing an organization at any given time.
- **Attack Surface:** All possible points where an unauthorized user can access a system.
- **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A security flaw unknown to the vendor, giving defenders zero days to patch.
- **Risk Management:** The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to organizational assets.
- **Defense in Depth:** Layered security approach using multiple defensive measures.

**Risk Matrix Notes**
- Risk = Likelihood × Impact
- Risks categorized by severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Organizations prioritize mitigation based on risk score and available resources
- Residual risk remains even after controls are implemented

**Quiz Results**
- Score: Passed (score visible in `2025-10-31_Module2_Completed.png`)
- Topics I understood well: Evolution timeline, risk calculation, defense in depth strategies
- Topics to review: None - concepts clear

**Connection to Ubuntu Project**
The T2 chip security decisions I made (disabling Secure Boot, managing SIP) demonstrate real-world risk management. I accepted increased boot flexibility (benefit) in exchange for reduced firmware validation (risk), then documented compensating controls—exactly the risk assessment framework taught in Module 2.

## Key Takeaways  

1. The CIA Triad defines how every security control is evaluated.  
2. Analysts must understand both technical defenses and human behavior.  
3. Communication and documentation are critical in incident response.
4. Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field responding to new threats and technologies.
5. Risk management requires balancing security controls with operational needs and available resources.

## Hands-On Labs  

**Lab Name:** No formal lab in Modules 1-2  
**Activity Type:** Guided learning and practice quizzes  
**Outcome:** Completed Module 1-2 knowledge checks and explored analyst responsibilities through scenario examples. Applied risk management concepts to real Ubuntu dual-boot security decisions.

## Questions / Confusion  

- How does each pillar of the CIA Triad translate into specific tools (e.g., which tools support Integrity vs Availability)?  
- When incident logs are analyzed, how do analysts measure "Integrity" violations quantitatively?  
- How do organizations balance security improvements against budget constraints in risk management?

## Next Steps  

- Start **Module 3 – Protect Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**
- Continue tracking threat actor techniques and defense strategies
- Begin SecureScholar Module 2 Lesson 1 writing
- Update weekly reflection by Sunday (Nov 2)

**Status:** Modules 1-2 complete (≈15% overall course progress). Core foundational concepts mastered. Ready for Module 3 threat analysis content.
