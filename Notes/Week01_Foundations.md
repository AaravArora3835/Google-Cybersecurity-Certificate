## Topics Covered

### Module 1.1: *Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity*

**Key Concepts:**

* Cybersecurity protects systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
* A **cybersecurity analyst** detects, investigates, and responds to threats.
* Security helps ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** (CIA Triad).
* Cybersecurity affects every industry and role—from small businesses to governments.

**Important Terms:**

* **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality (only authorized access), Integrity (data accuracy), Availability (systems accessible when needed).
* **Threat:** Any potential danger that exploits a vulnerability.
* **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited to cause harm.
* **Risk:** The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability.

## Key Takeaways

1. Cybersecurity analysts are the “first responders” to digital incidents.
2. The CIA Triad underpins nearly every security control or policy.
3. Cybersecurity is both technical (tools) and human (policy/behavior).
