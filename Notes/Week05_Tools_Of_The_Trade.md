# **Week 05 — Tools of the Trade: Linux & SQL**

**Date Range:** Dec 3 – Dec 7, 2025
**Total Hours:** [Fill at end of week]
**Phase:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Course 4

---

## **Topics Covered (Today — Dec 3)**

### **Module 1: Introduction to Linux & Assets**

**Key Concepts:**

* Purpose of Linux in cybersecurity
* File system hierarchy (`/home`, `/etc`, `/var`)
* Absolute vs relative paths
* Basic navigation commands
* Why Linux is used in security operations
* Importance of assets, vulnerabilities, and threats
* Relationship between asset value and security posture

**Important Terms:**

* **CLI:** Command Line Interface
* **Permissions:** Read, Write, Execute
* **Asset:** Any valuable resource to protect
* **Vulnerability:** Weakness an attacker can exploit
* **Threat:** Anything that can exploit a vulnerability

## **Labs Completed**

### **Linux Basics Lab (Dec 3)**

**Commands Practiced:**

* `pwd` — show current directory
* `ls` — list files
* `cd` — change directory
* `mkdir` — create folder
* `touch` — create a new file
* `chmod` — change permissions
* `sudo` — execute a command with elevated privilege
* `whoami` — current logged-in user

**Key Takeaways:**

* Linux is deterministic — everything is a file
* Permissions matter for security and system integrity
* Understanding navigation is critical before learning exploitation

## **Key Takeaways (Today)**

1. Linux navigation commands are essential for real-world cybersecurity work.
2. The Linux lab matched real scenarios (navigating logs, modifying permissions).
3. Asset → Threat → Vulnerability model connects directly to security tools.
4. Module 1 is a foundation for later SQL + exploitation in the course.
5. VulnForge tool upgrade today helps automate real CVE workflows.

## **Hands-On Work (Today)**

### **VulnForge Tool Update**

**Improvement Added:**

* Added `source_url` field to `new_case.py`
* Tested the tool successfully
* Confirmed new metadata appears in notes.md

**Why This Matters:**
This automation saves time when creating 12+ CVE cases later and keeps every case consistent.

## **Questions / Confusion**

* How advanced will SQL get in this course?
* Should I practice SQL outside the labs (DVWA / TryHackMe)?

---

## **Next Day Goals (Thu Dec 4)**

* Complete Linux Permissions Lab
* Complete SQL Basics Lab
* Add both lab files in `/Labs`
* Add Thursday notes to Week05 file

## **Reflection (Will fill on Dec 7)**
