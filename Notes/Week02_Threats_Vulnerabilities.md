# Week 02 – Threats, Vulnerabilities & Tools

**Date Range:** Nov 3 – Nov 10, 2025
**Total Hours:** ~4.5 hrs (Modules 3–4 Complete — Course 1 Finished)
**Phase:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate

---

## Topics Covered

### 2025-11-03 — Module 3: *Protect Against Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities*

**Key Concepts**

* **Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities** are interrelated: threats exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm, and risk measures the likelihood and impact of that harm.
* **Threat actors** include individuals or groups (hacktivists, cybercriminals, insiders, nation-states) who attempt to exploit weaknesses for financial, political, or personal gain.
* **Vulnerability → Exploit:** flaw vs. technique.
* **Risk Formula:** `Risk = Likelihood × Impact` — used to prioritize mitigation.
* **Defense Strategies:** patch management, least privilege, firewalls, IDS/IPS, regular vulnerability scans, and user training.
* **Incident Lifecycle:** Identify → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned.

### 2025-11-04 — Module 4: *Cybersecurity Tools & Local Practice*

**Key Concepts / Tools Practiced**

| Command                   | Purpose                              | Summary Output                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `nmap -sn 127.0.0.1`      | Network discovery (local host scan). | “Host is up (127.0.0.1)”             |
| `whoami`                  | Verify current user context.         | `labuser`                            |
| `grep "root" /etc/passwd` | Locate root entries in system files. | `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/zsh` |

Executed safely inside an **isolated Kali VM** (Host-Only network).

**Reflection**
This practice reinforced how core security tools work at the system level and showed how enumeration underpins vulnerability assessment. Understanding local scanning, privilege checks, and system files builds intuition for later labs and SecureScholar’s *Network Threats* module.

### 2025-11-05 — Module 4 Completed → **Course 1 Finished 🎉**

**Overview**
Completed all Module 4 videos, hands-on exercises, and the graded quiz—officially earning the **Course 1 Certificate (Foundations of Cybersecurity)**.

**What I Completed**

* Finalized Module 4 tool demonstrations and Python automation overview.
* Passed the Course 1 quiz and captured completion evidence.
* Reflected on the bridge between theory and applied practice.

**Screenshots / Evidence**

* `2025-11-05_Module4_Completed.png` — Coursera confirmation of Course 1 completion.

**Reflection**
Finishing Course 1 marks a milestone: I now understand both the “why” behind cybersecurity concepts and the “how” of basic tools. The transition from the CIA Triad to command-line execution gave me confidence to approach future labs with real-world discipline. This foundation connects directly to my SecureScholar work, where I’ll teach these same principles to others.
