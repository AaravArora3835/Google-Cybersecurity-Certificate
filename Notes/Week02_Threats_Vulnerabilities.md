## Topics Covered

### 2025-11-03 — Module 3: *Protect Against Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities*

**Key Concepts**

* **Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities** are interrelated: threats exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm, and risk measures the likelihood and impact of that harm.
* **Threat actors** include individuals or groups (hacktivists, cybercriminals, insiders, nation-states) who attempt to exploit weaknesses for financial, political, or personal gain.
* **Vulnerability** → flaw or weakness; **Exploit** → technique used to take advantage of that flaw.
* **Risk Formula:** `Risk = Likelihood × Impact` — helps prioritize mitigation efforts.
* **Defense Strategies:** patch management, least privilege, firewalls, IDS/IPS, regular vulnerability scans, and user training.
* **Incident Lifecycle:** Identify → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned.

**Important Terms**

* **Threat Actor:** A person or entity intentionally causing harm to digital assets.
* **Vulnerability:** A flaw in hardware, software, or procedure that could be exploited.
* **Exploit:** A specific method or tool that takes advantage of a vulnerability.
* **Risk:** The probability and potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
* **Mitigation:** Steps taken to reduce risk through technical or administrative controls.

**Real-World Example**
During the Equifax breach (2017), attackers exploited an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability. This case clearly illustrates the *risk formula*: high likelihood (unpatched system) × high impact (sensitive data) = critical risk.

## Key Takeaways

1. Understanding the connection between threat, vulnerability, and risk is essential for prioritizing defenses.
2. Regular patching and configuration management are among the most effective mitigation measures.
3. Insider threats remain one of the most underestimated risks.
4. The risk formula provides a quantifiable way to communicate security priorities to management.
5. Effective cybersecurity combines technology, policy, and human vigilance.

## Hands-On Labs

**Lab Name:** None (conceptual module)
**Activity Type:** Case-based learning + risk analysis exercise
**Outcome:** Identified and categorized risks using the likelihood × impact model; analyzed examples of threat actors and mitigation strategies.

## Questions / Confusion

* How do organizations calculate “impact” objectively in the risk formula—financial, reputational, or both?
* What frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-30) are most commonly used for enterprise risk assessment?
* Can machine learning assist in predicting vulnerability exploitation likelihood?

---

## Next Steps

* Begin **Module 4 – Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages** (Tuesday).
* Test local tools (`nmap`, `whoami`, `grep`) safely inside Kali Linux VM.
* Continue documenting outputs with screenshots.
* Maintain consistent commit messages (`doc:` for notes, `feat:` for code).

**Status:** Module 3 complete — solid understanding of threats, vulnerabilities, and risk management. Ready to start hands-on tool testing in Module 4.
