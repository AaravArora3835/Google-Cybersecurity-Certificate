# **Week 06 — Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**

**Date Range:** Dec 10 – Dec 14, 2025
**Total Hours:** 10
**Phase:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Course 5

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 10)**

### **Module 1: Introduction to Asset Security**

**Key Concepts:**

* Security and risk management fundamentals
* Asset classification and inventory management
* Data lifecycle stages (creation, storage, use, archival, destruction)
* Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
* Security governance and policy frameworks

**Important Terms:** Asset Classification, Data Lifecycle, Compliance, Governance, Risk Management

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 10)**

1. Asset management is the foundation of security programs — can't protect what you don't know exists.
2. Data lifecycle concepts connect directly to vulnerability management workflows.
3. Compliance frameworks drive real-world security decisions in organizations.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 10)**

Completed Module 1 video lectures and quizzes.
Reviewed asset classification examples.

**Purpose:** Understand organizational security context before diving into technical controls.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 11)**

* Module 2: Protect organizational assets
* Focus on encryption and access controls
* Take notes on authentication mechanisms

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 11)**

### **Module 2: Protect Organizational Assets**

**Key Concepts:**

* Security controls: technical, operational, managerial
* Encryption fundamentals (symmetric vs asymmetric)
* Authentication factors (something you know, have, are)
* Authorization and access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC)
* Principle of least privilege in practice
* Data states: at rest, in transit, in use

**Important Terms:** Encryption, Authentication, Authorization, Access Control, Least Privilege, MFA

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 11)**

1. Defense in depth requires layered controls — single protections always fail eventually.
2. Authentication and authorization are separate processes that work together.
3. Encryption protects confidentiality but doesn't prevent all attacks.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 11)**

Completed Module 2 content and assessments.
Studied access control model comparisons.

**Purpose:** Build understanding of protective mechanisms before studying attack methods.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 12)**

* Module 3: Vulnerabilities in systems
* Learn CVE and CVSS frameworks
* Connect to VulnForge documentation work

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 12)**

### **Module 3: Vulnerabilities in Systems**

**Key Concepts:**

* Common vulnerability types (buffer overflow, injection, misconfig)
* CVE identification system and numbering
* CVSS scoring methodology (Base, Temporal, Environmental metrics)
* Vulnerability assessment vs penetration testing
* Patch management lifecycle and prioritization
* Zero-day vulnerabilities and disclosure timelines
* Defense strategies for unpatched systems

**Important Terms:** CVE, CVSS, Vulnerability Scanner, Patch Management, Zero-Day, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 12)**

1. CVE/CVSS frameworks structure how security teams communicate about vulnerabilities.
2. Not all vulnerabilities are equal — CVSS scoring drives remediation priority.
3. Patch management requires balancing speed with testing and stability.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 12)**

Completed Module 3 lectures and quizzes.
Reviewed CVSS calculator examples.
Connected concepts to VulnForge CVE #1 documentation.

**Purpose:** Formalize vulnerability research methodology for future case studies.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 13)**

* Module 4: Threats to asset security
* Study threat actor motivations
* Understand attack vectors

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 13)**

### **Module 4: Threats to Asset Security**

**Key Concepts:**

* Threat actor categories (nation-state, organized crime, hacktivists, insider)
* Attack vectors and attack surfaces
* Social engineering techniques (phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating)
* Malware types (virus, worm, trojan, ransomware, spyware)
* Threat intelligence sources and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Kill chain and attack lifecycle models

**Important Terms:** Threat Actor, Attack Vector, Social Engineering, Malware, Threat Intelligence, IOC

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 13)**

1. Understanding attacker motivations helps predict likely attack methods.
2. Social engineering exploits human weakness — technical controls can't prevent all attacks.
3. Threat intelligence informs proactive defense rather than reactive incident response.

---

# **Hands-On Work (Dec 13)**

Completed Module 4 content and assessments.
Analyzed threat actor case studies.

**Purpose:** Develop attacker mindset to improve defensive strategies in CVE work.

---

# **Next Day Goals (Dec 14)**

* Complete Course 5 final assessment
* Create vulnerability assessment report
* Document week's progress
* Screenshot course completion

---

# **Topics Covered (Dec 14)**

### **Course 5 Review & Vulnerability Assessment Report**

**Key Concepts:**

* Integrating asset classification with vulnerability management
* Risk assessment using likelihood and impact scoring
* Security control selection based on threat landscape
* Creating professional vulnerability reports
* Communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders

**Important Terms:** Risk Assessment, Vulnerability Report, Security Controls, Risk Matrix, Mitigation Strategy

---

# **Labs Completed (Dec 14)**

### **Vulnerability Assessment Report Exercise**

**Skills Practiced:**

* Identifying and documenting system vulnerabilities
* Applying CVSS scoring methodology
* Writing mitigation recommendations
* Creating executive summaries for technical findings
* Organizing evidence and supporting documentation

**Key Takeaways:**
Professional reporting requires both technical accuracy and clear communication.
Vulnerability documentation structure mirrors VulnForge CVE format.
Reports must provide actionable recommendations, not just problem identification.

---

# **Key Takeaways (Dec 14)**

1. Course 5 connected asset management, vulnerabilities, and threats into complete risk picture.
2. Vulnerability assessment report demonstrates professional security analysis skills.
3. Ready to apply Course 5 concepts to CVE #2 planning.

# **Weekly Reflection**

**What Worked:**
* Focused week on completing entire course without lab distractions.
* Vulnerability assessment report provided practical application of all four modules.
* Course 5 content directly supports VulnForge methodology and CVE documentation.

**What Could Improve:**
* No hands-on labs this week — next week needs practical work to balance theory.
* Should have taken more detailed daily notes during lectures.
* Need to schedule CVE #2 initialization for next week.

**Connections Made:**
* CVE/CVSS frameworks from Module 3 explain how to properly score VulnForge cases.
* Access control concepts (Module 2) relate to privilege escalation attacks.
* Threat intelligence (Module 4) shows how to research real-world attack patterns.
* Asset classification (Module 1) determines which vulnerabilities matter most.

**Next Week Focus:**
* Start Course 6 (Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response)
* Initialize VulnForge CVE #2 (target: XSS or privilege escalation)
* Return to hands-on lab work after theory-heavy week
* Update GitHub portfolio with Week 06 documentation
