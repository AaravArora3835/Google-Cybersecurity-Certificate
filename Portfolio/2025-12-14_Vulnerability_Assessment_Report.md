## **Purpose**

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the security risks associated with the company’s publicly accessible database server and its impact on business operations. The database stores critical customer and business data that directly supports revenue generation and remote employee workflows. If compromised, the organization could face data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory consequences. Additionally, an outage or attack against the server could disrupt daily operations and prevent employees from accessing essential information. This assessment aims to identify key threats and recommend controls to reduce risk and protect business continuity.

## **Risk Assessment**

| **Threat Source**   | **Threat Event**                            | **Likelihood (1–3)** | **Severity (1–3)** | **Risk Score (L × S)** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| External attacker   | Unauthorized access to public database      | 3                    | 3                  | 9                      |
| Cybercriminal group | Data exfiltration of customer information   | 3                    | 3                  | 9                      |
| Business competitor | Denial of service attack on database server | 2                    | 3                  | 6                      |

## **Approach**

This assessment uses a qualitative risk analysis approach based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 to evaluate likely threats to the database server. The identified threat sources were selected because publicly accessible systems are commonly targeted by external attackers and cybercriminal groups. Unauthorized access and data exfiltration present severe risks due to the sensitivity of customer information and potential legal and reputational consequences. A denial of service attack was also included because availability of the database is critical for remote employees. These threats represent the most significant risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of business data.

## **Remediation**

To remediate and mitigate the identified risks, the organization should restrict public access to the database server and enforce the principle of least privilege. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control using the AAA framework will help prevent unauthorized access. Defense-in-depth strategies, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation, should be applied to reduce attack exposure. Encrypting sensitive data and implementing regular monitoring and logging will further protect against data exfiltration and support incident response efforts.
