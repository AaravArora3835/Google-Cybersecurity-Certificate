## Executive Summary

Cybersecurity risk is not abstract or corporate; it exists in every household and classroom.
The formula **Risk = Likelihood × Impact** captures its essence: how probable an event is and how damaging it would be.
This issue translates professional frameworks such as NIST SP 800-30 and CIS Controls v8 into practical actions anyone can take to reduce everyday digital exposure.

## Understanding Risk at a Personal Level

In simple terms, *risk* measures how likely something is to go wrong and how much harm it could cause.
High-likelihood, high-impact events demand attention first.
Reusing passwords, delaying software updates, or ignoring two-factor authentication all raise both factors simultaneously—turning small oversights into serious vulnerabilities.

## The NIST SP 800-30 Framework in Plain Language

Organizations rely on NIST SP 800-30 to assess and prioritize cybersecurity threats.
The process consists of six steps that can be applied even to personal technology management:

1. **Identify Assets** – Know what you must protect (laptop, phone, accounts).
2. **Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities** – Recognize what could exploit them.
3. **Determine Likelihood and Impact** – Estimate how often and how severely issues might occur.
4. **Calculate Risk Level** – Multiply likelihood by impact to rank priorities.
5. **Select Controls** – Choose technical or behavioral safeguards.
6. **Monitor and Review** – Reassess regularly as conditions change.

This structured reasoning is the same whether defending an enterprise network or protecting a single student’s online identity.

## Practical Application — Key CIS Controls v8

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) outlines 18 Critical Controls.
Three apply directly to individuals managing digital risk:

| Control # | Title                           | Personal Application                                                      |
| :-------: | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     1     | Inventory and Control of Assets | Keep a list of personal devices and review what accounts are logged in.   |
|     5     | Account Management              | Use unique, complex passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.     |
|     8     | Audit Log Management            | Review account login activity monthly (Google, Discord, or social media). |

Adopting even these three dramatically reduces exposure to the most common attack paths.

## Real-World Example — Target HVAC Vendor Breach (2013)

Attackers compromised the network credentials of an HVAC vendor connected to Target’s systems.
That small vendor’s weak security granted indirect access to customer payment data, leading to millions of dollars in losses.
The incident illustrates that risk often enters through trusted partners—and that understanding access relationships is as critical for individuals as for corporations.

## Reflection Prompts

* Which risk factor—likelihood or impact—do I underestimate most in my daily digital habits?
* What one action could cut my personal cyber-risk in half today?
* How does documenting risk awareness improve my judgment when using online platforms?
