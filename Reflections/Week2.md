## Week 02 Reflection — Threats, Vulnerabilities & SecureScholar Coding

**Date Range:** Nov 3 – Nov 8 2025
**Total Hours:** ~10.5 hrs

### Biggest Win

Finishing the **Vulnerability Scan Lab** and integrating it into my notes was the highlight of the week. Running Nmap locally against the OWASP Juice Shop container helped me see how port scanning, service detection, and header enumeration translate theory into practice. It was the first time I connected the Google Certificate’s “risk and vulnerability” concepts to an actual working target.

---

### Hardest Challenge

Configuring **Docker + VirtualBox networking** required careful troubleshooting. At first, the containers couldn’t reach the host, but adjusting NAT + Host-Only adapters fixed the issue. The process taught me how virtual environments interact and why isolation is critical for safe testing.

---

### Skill Improved

I developed stronger command-line fluency in **Kali Linux** and gained confidence interpreting scan results. I also learned to document findings clearly, connecting technical data (open ports, services, and headers) to human-readable explanations that recruiters or instructors can understand.

---

### Connection to SecureScholar

While the Google lab focused on system vulnerabilities, my **SecureScholar Module 2 coding** focused on human vulnerabilities—specifically phishing. Writing the first full lesson (“What is Phishing?”) and implementing quiz logic showed how education can be a powerful defense mechanism. Together, both projects advanced my goal of blending technical skill with outreach and awareness.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. Every scan or script is a form of communication—between analyst and system.
2. Safe lab environments enable curiosity without risk.
3. Clear documentation converts isolated experiments into portfolio evidence.
4. Technical skill and educational impact can develop in parallel.

### What I’d Do Differently

I’d streamline setup earlier in the week so more time could be spent analyzing vulnerabilities rather than fixing network adapters. For the next phase, I’ll document configuration steps immediately after each change to avoid repeated troubleshooting.

### Looking Ahead

Next week begins **Course 2 – Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks** and **SecureScholar Module 2 Quiz System**. The focus will shift from scanning to interpreting risk and designing user interactions that reinforce security awareness.

**Status:** Week 2 complete — Course 1 finished, labs executed, and SecureScholar Module 2 Lesson 1 live with quiz foundation.
