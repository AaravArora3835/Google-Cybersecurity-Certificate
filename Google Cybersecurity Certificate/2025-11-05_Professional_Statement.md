### Draft: Professional Statement (Aarav Arora)

My name is **Aarav Arora**, a high school student passionate about protecting digital systems and empowering others to use technology safely. I’m pursuing a multi-year cybersecurity roadmap that includes hands-on labs, professional certifications, and community projects that raise cybersecurity awareness among students and families.

My **core strengths** include analytical problem-solving, persistence, and attention to detail. I enjoy breaking down complex technical issues and translating them into clear, actionable solutions. My **values**—integrity, curiosity, and a desire to help others—drive how I approach every challenge.

I’m drawn to **cybersecurity** because it’s a field where critical thinking and ethical responsibility intersect. I want to defend organizations and individuals from threats that can disrupt lives and operations. Through continuous learning in areas like Linux, networking, and incident response, I’m building a foundation to become a cybersecurity analyst capable of safeguarding information and maintaining trust.

As I continue my learning journey, I aim to apply my strengths to meet an organization’s security goals—reducing risk, ensuring data confidentiality, and promoting a culture of security awareness. My long-term goal is to contribute to a team that protects critical systems and helps others feel safe in the digital world.
